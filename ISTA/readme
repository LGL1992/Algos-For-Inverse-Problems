%% Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm. ISTA is SD + Soft Threshold


% More Effective when the signal is sparse .

% minimize ||Ax-y||2 + lambda ||x||1 w.r.t x

% This snipped solves a deblurring problem of the form Ax = y. A is the
% blurring operator (BCCB ), x is true image and the y is blurred image.

% A = m x m 
% x = m x 1  (in image form, x is a x b, where ab = m)
% y = m x 1  (in image form, y is a x b, where ab = m)

% We neither vectorize x nor y. Rather we solve the problem in the image
% domain using the properties of BCCB matrix.

% A = F'LF. 
% F = m x m (2D DFT matrix)
% L = m x m diagonal matrix with entries being 2D DFT of the Point spread
% function of the blur matrix A.
