% This is a small demostration showing truncated SVD. For ill-conditioned matrices, 
% many of the eigenvalues, while not zero, can become quite small causing the data
% inversion to blow up if there is any noise at all present (and thereis always is 
% noise present). To prevent this, only the first n are included.
