% MP is a simple algorithm, that can solve for x which is sparse
% in its domain, assuming given an underdetermined orthogonal sen
% -sing matrix. For simplicity we assumed that sensing matrix is of
% full rank. This is a simple program that shows MP can solve forx.
% In reality, there is no gaurantee that, MP converges.
